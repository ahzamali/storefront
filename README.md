# StoreFront v2

> **Note**: This project was completely generated by **Antigravity**, an advanced AI coding assistant by Google DeepMind.

StoreFront v2 is a modern, hybrid retail management system designed to bridge the gap between central warehouses ("Master Stores") and pop-up retail locations ("Virtual Stores").

## 🏗 Architecture

The system is built as a monorepo containing three distinct components:

| Component | Tech Stack | Location | Description |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Server** | Spring Boot, H2 DB, Java 17 | `/server` | Central API, Auth, and Inventory management. |
| **Web** | React, Vite | `/web` | Admin dashboard for HQ inventory control. |
| **Android** | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose | `/android` | Point-of-Sale (POS) app for employees. |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Master Inventory**: Centralized stock management with auto-seeding.
- **Real-Time Stock View**: Monitor inventory levels instantly from the web dashboard.
- **H2 Persistence**: File-based database storage that persists across restarts.
- **Virtual Stores**: Allocate stock to temporary locations for events/pop-ups.
- **Bundle Sales**: Sell product bundles with flexible exclusions.

## 📡 API Reference

### Orders
- **Create Order**: `POST /api/v1/orders`
  - Body: `{ "storeId": 1, "items": [...], "customerName": "John", "customerPhone": "123" }`
- **Search Orders**: `GET /api/v1/orders`
  - Query Params:
    - `customerName`: Partial case-insensitive match.
    - `customerPhone`: Partial match.

### Inventory
- **Search Store Inventory**: `GET /api/v1/stores/{storeId}/inventory`
  - Query Params:
    - `search`: Matches Product Name OR ISBN (inside JSON attributes).

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 17 or higher.
- **Node.js**: v18+ (for Web Dashboard).
- **Android Studio**: For running the mobile app.

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Backend Server

The server is the heart of the system. It uses an H2 file-based database.

```bash
cd server
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- **API URL**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **H2 Console**: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
  - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:file:./data/storefront;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;MODE=PostgreSQL`
  - User: `sa` / Password: (empty)

### 2. Web Dashboard

The admin interface for managing the system.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (typically)
- **Login**: Use the admin credentials created during seeding (if applicable) or register a new admin via API if dev mode is open.

### 3. Android App

Open the `/android` folder in Android Studio and run on an emulator or device. Ensure the device serves as a bridge to `localhost` (e.g., using `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`).
